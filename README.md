### Anuj Naresh Chetwani

I'm Anuj Naresh Chetwani, a graduate student at North Carolina State University with a passion for software development, DevOps, and data science. Currently, my focus is on code migrations, database management and the implementation of GANs. Additionally, I'm expanding my skills by learning web development, DataOps, MLops, and DevOps. 

I'm eager to collaborate on projects where I can contribute my expertise in implementing automation and deployment strategies for seamless software delivery. I'm also interested in exploring innovative solutions that combine machine learning algorithms with software engineering practices.

Feel free to reach out to me at achetwa@ncsu.edu to discuss potential collaborations or to connect. I'm always excited to engage in discussions related to my areas of interest and make open source contributions.
