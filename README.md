I'm Anuj Naresh Chetwani, a graduate student at North Carolina State University with a passion for software development, machine learning, and data science. Currently, my focus is on code migrations, database management and the implementation of GANs. Additionally, I'm expanding my skills by learning web development, DataOps, MLops, and DevOps. During my free time, I enjoy practicing dynamic programming and exploring various developer patterns.

I'm eager to collaborate on projects where I can contribute my expertise in implementing automation and deployment strategies for seamless software delivery. I'm also interested in exploring innovative solutions that combine machine learning algorithms with software engineering practices.

Feel free to reach out to me at achetwa@ncsu.edu to discuss potential collaborations or to connect. I'm always excited to engage in discussions related to my areas of interest and make open source contributions. A small piece of my work includes in contributuing to the development of expertiza website for my school as a part of my course work, details for the PR https://github.com/expertiza/reimplementation-back-end/pull/37 And video can be found here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcvB9SKb-bw&t=19s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcvB9SKb-bw)
